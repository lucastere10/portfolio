      <description>This project will use a dataset with a companyâ€™s ideal customers attributes. The dataset consists of the costumers basics information, including ID, birth year, education, marriage status and income. In this project my interest is try to understand the costumer profile and analyze their behavior. Being capable of clustering costumers by their interests is great to make products based on their expectations, allowing a further analysis on product mix. Considering that, i&amp;rsquo;ll cluster costumers based on their similarities and them show what to focus based on each cluster.</description>
